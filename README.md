Predictive Analytics:
Trajectory Prediction: Use machine learning models (e.g., LSTM networks) to predict future positions of debris based on historical data.
Pattern Recognition: Implement AI to identify and learn patterns in orbital changes, such as those caused by atmospheric drag or gravitational perturbations.
Anomaly Detection:
AI-Driven Detection: Apply anomaly detection algorithms to identify unexpected behavior in debris, such as sudden changes in orbit that might indicate collisions or explosions![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc837ed9-7607-4e76-9f87-41e412dfab51)
